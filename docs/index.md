* **Public vs. Private Blockchain**: Public blockchains are open to anyone, and every transaction on the blockchain is transparent. A private blockchain, also known as permissioned blockchain, restricts the ability to write to the distributed ledger to one organization, or only to a set group of people.

* **Full Nodes**: These are nodes in the blockchain network that validate and relay transactions, maintain a copy of the entire blockchain, and enforce the consensus rules of the system.

* **Scalability**: In the context of blockchain architecture, scalability refers to the capability of a blockchain to handle and process large amounts of transactions without impacting its speed or performance.

* **Cryptography**: In a blockchain context, cryptography is the method used to secure the identities and transactions of network participants, by converting transaction data into complex codes.

* **Hash Function**: In blockchain, a hash function is used to convert an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length. 

* **Double Spending**: This refers to the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice, which is a potential problem unique to digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced relatively easily.

* **Genesis Block**: This is the first block of a blockchain, and it is the foundation on which additional blocks are added to form a blockchain.

* **Permissioned vs. Permissionless**: Permissioned blockchains require pre-verification of participants before they can join the network, whereas permissionless blockchains are open and allow anyone to participate.
